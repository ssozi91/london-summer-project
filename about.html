        <p>
            My interest in computers started way back when i was in junia school,<br>
            my sister had a computer, which got me so interested to learn what it was doing <br>
            i did my first computer course when i was 14 where i learnt about microsoft office<br>
            and some bits of how to use the computer,<br>
            Tried to get on university to do the software eng but didnt finish it but gained <br>
            more knowledge about machine language and some bits of coding.<br>
            when i come to uk, decided to polish up my dream to learn coding and with the help <br>
            of CYF i learnt to use web technologies like html css,javascript and many more.<br>
