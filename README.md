# Personal Website
* A personal website that will be built within the 3 week gap.
* There will be multiple sections and a backend.
* They will be making calls to the Github API as well as to their own backend.
* All the (reusable) CSS should be coming from their own skin-css fork.

## Part 1 (week 1)

* Responsive website with all the sections: about, github repositories, experience, contact page.
* API call to GitHub that lists their projects. 
* The github credentials will have to be stored in environment variables. 
* Get the contents of the README files, convert them from MD to HTML (find and use a library) and display them on the website.

## Part 2 (week 2)

* Add a games section to the website.
* Write a simple game where the backend provides numbers and the operator (addition|subtraction etc). 
* The user needs to provide the result of the operation. Then the server gets the response and replies with the result (correct|incorrect). 
* There also needs to be a score. Once they lose they will be adding their name to a leaderboard. 
* The names will be stored in a JSON file.

## Part 3 (week 3)

* Add another game - Find the pairs game: http://mypuzzle.org/find-the-pair
* Some JSON config and leaderboards.
* *Optional*: Add authentication to the API routes.
